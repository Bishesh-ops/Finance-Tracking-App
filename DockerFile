# --- MODIFIED: Command to run the application using Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers ---
# We use gunicorn to manage uvicorn workers for production stability and performance.
# The --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 makes it listen on the correct port.
# The --workers parameter can be adjusted (2*CPU_CORES + 1 is a common formula).
